## Overview

You will be working in teams to make a clone of a common [micro-blogging](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microblogging) platform. You will be given a back-end API for you to form your front-end application around. The API will include endpoints relating to authentication, users, messages, and likes. Your project must incorporate a majority of the endpoints given in the API.

You will also be following the SCRUM process and assuming roles of either Product Owner, Scrum Master, or QA Tester. Please see this document for more details:
